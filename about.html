            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p class="large-text">
                Founded in 2004 by Attorney Michael James and Attorney Chioma Jacobs, our firm was built on a simple principle: every client deserves fierce representation and personal attention.
            </p>
            <p>
                For over two decades, we have proudly served individuals, families, and businesses across Lagos and beyond. What started as a small practice has grown into one of the most respected law firms in the region — not because we are the biggest, but because we fight the hardest for our clients.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, James & Jacobs Law Firm continues to uphold the values of integrity, excellence, and compassion that our founders established from day one.
